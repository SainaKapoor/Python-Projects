#A classic Rock, paper, scissor game with new members called SPock and Lizard

#Question:
#1. Write a python program for the Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard game. The rules of the game
#are:
#Spock beats scissors and rock, but loses to paper and lizard.
#Lizard beats Spock and paper, but loses to rock and scissors.
#Rock beats scissors and lizard, but loses to paper and Spock.
#Paper beats rock and Spock, but loses to scissors and lizard.
#Scissors beats paper and lizard, but loses to rock and Spock.
#The program will have two players and each of them produce a random outcome, i.e., Rock,
#paper, scissor, spock, or lizard. Based on each playerâ€™s outcome, determine the winner.

#Defining Player1 and Player2 variable to choose random object from game
player1 = random.choice(game)

#Printing what each player choice
print("Player 1 chose:", player1)
print("Player 2 chose:", player2)

#Checking for the conditions
